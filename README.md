# quickdraw-gan-vae
This repository contains a GAN and a VAE trained on the Quick, Draw! dataset to generate new images from five selected classes. It includes a Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and results.

## Structure

1. [`quickdraw_gan_vae.ipynb`](./quickdraw_gan_vae.ipynb): Final report for this project
2. [`best_vae_model.h5`](./best_vae_model.h5): Best VAE model
3. [`best_gan_model.h5`](./best_gan_model.h5): Best GAN model
4. [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt): Required dependencies
5. [`/gan`](./gan) and [`/vae`](./vae): Folders containing other images from the training process
